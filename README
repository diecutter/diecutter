Templates as a service.

``diecutter`` exposes an API where you manage templates as resources.
The most common operation is to **POST data to templates in order to retrieve
generated files**.

Files and directories are supported. Directories are rendered as archives.

.. note::

   Diecutter is under active development: some (killer) features have not been
   implemented yet, or they are not mature.
   Check `milestones <https://github.com/novagile/diecutter/issues/milestones>`_
   and `vision <https://diecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/about/vision.html>`_
   for details.

   That said, features documented below actually work, so **give it a try!**
